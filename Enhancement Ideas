DONE v0.4.01 : Melding/Scoring/Valuation

Hand:
- NOT DONE: Present sorted?

Scoring/Valuation:- move to separate class
- DONE: Card should only know about base scoring and perhaps return two different values (base score and wildcard score) - move scoring out of it
- DONE: A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds;
- DONE: On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize
- DONE: Stuff from piece of paper / notes on iPad
- DONE: Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - DONE: Different scoring for when I have 1 or 2 cards unmelded (should be looking to meld to existing)

- DONE: use isTestBetterThanBest in considering permutations
    - >>> override 1/2 value for partial melds ??(necessary? now that we are promoting other measures)

Previously Done:
    - DONE: Move out of getHighestScoreCard
    - DONE: Permuations Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0
    - DONE: Loop over discards - this will allow us to merge some code
    - DONE: reuse Meld.check within meldAndEvaluate
-     DONE: have a permutations version without an added card


-----------------------

DONE: Meld: Mark what type of meld it is: full/partial, sequence/rank
- Make Meld a standalone class?
DONE: a partial rank meld >> partial sequence > partial sequence at one end = broken sequence
DONE: A rank meld > rank meld with wildcards > sequence meld


----------------------
v0.4.03 Clean Up and Refactoring
DONE: change takeComputerTurn and takeHumanTurn to Player methods
- comments from Catherine
    * DONE: don't like "add scores" phrasing
    * everything is so small?
    * DONE: too many spins when discarding -- hard to see what card is
    * DONE: watching it deal is gonna get boring
    * why is it so hard to discard?
    * DONE: why can't I just play each turn in one button except for mine
        - move Take Turn button to clicking on the actual player (which should be jiggling)
DONE: Move [Play] button to clicking on the next player (bouncing or shaking)
    - change Toast in first few rounds to help
DONE:    * can't see the horrific red scores
DONE: Look at Player list in Game for better encapsulation
DONE: When you continue with a new game sometimes the old Layouts are not all removed
DONE: This doesn't handle if removed player is the dealer

        - especially Play button
        - if it's a new round, then indicate that (check GameState)
DONE For Humans, don't show cards until second touch of card (before show card backs)
    - Add an extra click to expose your cards if human players are next to each other
DONE: Remove Deprecated code

DONE: check critical TODO:A's!!!
DONE: cancel animation if I get bored with dealing
        - if you just touch the screen or the Play button
DONE: Call Meld.check on Computer Heuristics hands to order correctly

FIXED: If you drag a card to the Discard Pile before the appropriate time, it crashes
BUG: New Game after game complete crashes
FIXED: Drag after you've dragged to Discard Pile

FIXED: On Human hand, clicking on something else cancels the ability to draw a card
FIXED: Animate Dealing false, miniHands are now staying transparent
IGNORED: addWildcardsAndRecord: wildCards.isEmpty and isFinalTurn - not really a bug
FIXED: Final hand is updating Cumulative Score before roundScore arrives

v0.5.60 Card size and scaling
 Hands need to fill the space on the Android tablet
DONE    - produce scaled cards for different resolutions
DONE    - Scale mini-hands to 50%/75% of DrawPile
DONE- green border too big on bottom - use adjustView
DONE   3. Cards are too small (especially on Nexus 7 running android 4.4.3) - need a version of the cards for bigger screens?
      4. Hard to distinguish suits, especially spades/clubs and blue diamonds. Perhaps use the jumbo cards?
    - 5.  Lighter shade on the blue to so it stands out better -- maybe red too.

DONE    Animated cards being clipped by top RelativeLayout
DONE        Computer animated pickup is happening x-shifted to right
DONE        The "deal pile" is too big during the deal animation - need to record the scaling factor??

    - DONE: Animation when a card is picked from Draw or Discard
DONE- Make discard/draw pile bigger and cards bigger?
========================
v0.6.01
DONE    - It would be nice if the hand would sort if you tap on it. When you have 10 or 12 cards and are trying to decide whether
      or not to pick up that first card, it would help those who need their cards sorted to play :-)

   DONE- WHen Human picks card, it uses the static animation - need to animate it from the pile to the cards
   DONE when you go out, score goes from random place - needs to go from between Hands and Melds
     - when hands are re-laid out , moving card may be wrong (could be on next hand) - need to split?
    DONE when you change orientation, resets to the grayed out hand instead of showing a card (or not)

    (should be able to do just by removing the DiscardPile so null shows)
FIXED: Switch Computer and Human to make it easier to play for right-handed
FIXED: Outline around where the discard pile should be
FIXED: If you change Human to Computer it crashes sometimes

FIXED: Outline for the discard pile on N9 is all stretched out vertically when in landscape... Better in portrait..
FIXED: Nexus 9: Sizes are not scaled correctly in landscape mode
    - need cards and card backs scaled to hdpi,., xhdpi, and xxhdpi

[Kim] Samsung 8 tablet

    (Reduced the inter-meld spacing)
[Released to Google Player Beta]
----------------------------------------
0.7.19 Logic and helpful graphics
BUGS
[Tim]
FIXED When it's the computer's turn, if you double-click on the computer hand it plays twice
    - this is almost certainly a consequence of removing the problem with clicking human hand would skip your turn
FIXED If you change from landscape to portrait after the computer discards and before you click on your own hand, you can see the computer's hand and what it is working on...
FIXED: If you change orientation after the first click on pass-and-play, you get another turn
FIXED: Discard pile outline is big when there's no card there

FIXED?: Sometimes small score is colored red (generally the last hand - perhaps because it was red the previous hand?)
FIXED: If you change orientation *before* the first human player, it screws up which hand is jiggling

CHANGES:
DONE: animate one card to discardPile at end of dealing
DONE: If Human-after-Human logic applies, add a forced hint
DONE: Automatically hide human hand if next hand is human
-----------------------
0.7.20 Remaining graphics bugs

FIXED?: Sometimes when you delete a player it doesn't disappear properly
FIXED?: [New Game] through menu doesn't seem to let you add players
FIXED?: Hiding Hand hint shows when you change orientation some time - because updateHandsAndCards always calls the human one

    -- also should reset the scores, and clear the discard, but leave the mini hands

[Released to Alpha channel on Google Play]
[Promoted to Beta channel on 11/11/2015]
------------
Branched
v0.8.13 Bug fixes
BUG:- Problem where cards get stuck at bottom of screen (may be on Q's or K's round with card to far right) - look at addToMeld and drag code
-- When you drag card to a meld it seems to stay in the main cards
BUG: Tim's problem where it didn't recognize his completed meld
BUG: If you are showing Computer Cards, and tap on it to display them, then switch orientation/pause --> when you come back the piles will be animated
    and you can play for the computer :)
BUG: If you change orientation during [Start Game] you can sometimes catch the hand shaking (crashes if you tap it)

------------------

- Add two more levels of Computer player (Easy, Hard, Expert)
- Warn you if you don't meld in your final turn (or automatically meld your hand)

   - or just copies cards to the meld area and then melds them using meld.check
   - or force show Computer hand for first two rounds to see how it plays
=====================

v0.9.01 Graphics

- When Computer hand is displayed, it starts from center and if there are lots of pairs they go off the screen
  (unlike Human hand which expands from center in each direction)
- Redisplay red/yellow hand outlines on restart; also white outlines seem inconsistent
- Bounce the picked up card once it's in the hand (or highlight it?)
- Slide out hand animation
- Animate open hands into view from mini-hands
- 1. Expect the game to play the compute turn without clicking, while showing your (human) hand still
- Show score table at end - possibly with round-by-round scores?
    - Try exploding into middle of screen with fade-out
    - other comments like Phase 10: pick up a discard and say "Thanks! I really needed that" or "Ouch!"
- [Play] button and Scores on cards should scale to card size
- Hi-res cards have bloated the size of the APK by 4M - can we shrink it?

=======================
v0.9.50 Cleanup

- Tidy up FiveKings (order of event handlers, follow flow)
- Player methods use fKActivity and a lot of convoluted logic
    - Improve logic flow and understandability of FiveKings, Game, PlayerLayout etc
    - Clean up Game state flow and handling
    - push player Hand updates to individual players rather than mass updates of screen
    - more sub-classing rather than if (isHuman) type logic
- Clean up TODO:A 's
- Remove smells where possible :)

=====================
v1.1.01 Scoring and Valuation Bugs
(deemphasize this because computer is good enough)

BUGS
[Carolyn]
    - I've seen a couple of times when the computer gave itself more points than it should have.  I think it happens if it
      is saving one card for a run, e.g. 10C,JC, but has two other of one of those cards (JS,JD).  It doesn't move the jack
      over to the pair to meld them.
BUG: Meld.check on Heuristics is showing Joker-3-4
- Droid should have kept KS-KD-QS-6-4, but instead kept KS-KD-9-6-4 on round of 5's
- Droid should keep 10C-QC and QD to preserve two partial melds, but instead threw 10C
- In Q's round, computer preferred 6-Q-8 with 10-J unmelded over 8-Q-10-J with 6 unmelded (even though test #2 prefers the config with more melded cards)
 -- Maybe because of this bug (only finds broken sequences of x-?-z)
BUG:A Heuristics won't build a sequence X-Y-Jok-Z; not looking at this - use meld.check?

BUG:A Check if still true? Heuristics is throwing away wildcard when you have a partial meld of 4-4 and only full melds;
BUG:A Permutations won't build a K onto T*Q



================
v1.2 Improved Scoring and Valuation
- Look at melding "potential" of single unmelded cards you keep (not just partial melds)
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
Permutations:
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?
- ??use sorted lists
- implement Meld.needsCheck
- track what is left in DrawPile

Use Meld.check somehow?
    - note the numCard breakpoint when we switched to permutations and don't look for sequences bigger than this
    - should allow us to build bigger sequences
Improved Discard logic
    - Logic for pick up and discard on final turn is different. Goal is only to minimize score. So DrawVsDiscard comparator should only be comparing that potential.
      After picking from  Discard pile, no change should be necessary. After picking from Draw pile minimize score.

Heuristics:
Add in more than one sequence and longer sequences than 3
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)


================
v1.x
- Look at CardList implementation and consider LinkedHashSet or others which provide
    - check for non-duplicates
    - automatic ordering
- investigate using Callback instead of Listener (does it make it easier to find card?)
