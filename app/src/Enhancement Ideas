v0.4.00 : Melding/Scoring/Valuation
- Stuff from piece of paper / notes on iPad
    - Loop over discards - this will allow us to merge some code
    - reuse Meld.check within meldAndEvaluate
- if Computer is out, should just use Discard pile
Hand:
- Present sorted?
- TODO:A's
- DONE: have a permutations version without an added card

Scoring/Valuation:- move to separate class
- Card should only know about base scoring and perhaps return two different values (base score and wildcard score) - move scoring out of it
- A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds; a partial rank meld > partial sequence
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
- KD sequence is lower frequency, so not preferred over rank melds
- On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize

- Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - Different scoring for when I have 1 or 2 cards unmelded (should be looking to meld to existing)
    - track what is left in DrawPile (or cheat and remember it)
    - Cheat mode where it peeks at draw pile card
    - In the round of n, if you already have m cards in melds, then if m+3 >n then you should value a partial meld at full value
    (because you must meld to the existing melds to go out)
- Guard against human trying to put all cards in one meld (and it working!)
    - if it's *not* a meld, can we bail early? (depends which mode we're testing in)

Permutations:
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?
- use sorted lists
- implement Meld.needsCheck

Heuristics:
- Add in more than one sequence
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)
- Use Meld.check somehow? (but note the numCard breakpoint when we switched to permutations)

Previously Done:
    - DONE: Move out of getHighestScoreCard
    - DONE: Permuations Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0

----------------------
v0.4.01
- Look at CardList implementation and consider LinkedHashSet or others which provide
    - check for non-duplicates
    - automatic ordering
- Look at Player list in Game for better encapsulation

-------------------
v0.5.00 Graphics
- Animate open hands into view from mini-hands
- Hint overlays like Google (arrows and text)
- investigate using Callback instead of Listener (does it make it easier to find card?)

- Find a suit of Stars
- Add button to [Meld] for you (with a number of times you can use it?)
    - or only in first few rounds
- Better [Play] and [Meld] button design (find a good image)
    - replace button at bottom of screen with spinner or arrow to click
- LOTS of cleaning up in FiveKings - follow flow
- Slide out hand animation
- Touch Computer hand to play it
- Landscape layout: isn't switching automatically when I turn the device

    - DONE: Fix annoying menu popup problem
