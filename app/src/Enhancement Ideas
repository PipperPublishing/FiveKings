---------------------------
v0.2.00 : Melding/Scoring/Valuation
- Stuff from piece of paper / notes on iPad
    - Loop over discards - this will allow us to merge some code
Hand:
- Present sorted?
- TODO's
- have a permutations version without an added card

Scoring/Valuation:- move to separate class
- Move out of getHighestScoreCard
- Card should only know about base scoring and perhaps return two different values (base score and wildcard score) - move scoring out of it
- A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds; a partial rank meld > partial sequence
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
- KD sequence is lower frequency, so not preferred over rank melds
- On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize
- Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - track what is left in DrawPile (or cheat and remember it)
    - Cheat mode where it peeks at draw pile card

Permutations:
- Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?
- use sorted lists

Heuristics:
- Add in more than one sequence
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)
- Discard: find largest meld; remove card
- create separate list without wildcards - would remove the checks we have to do
- use sorted lists

- In the round of n, if you already have m cards in melds, then if m+3 >n then you should value a partial meld at full value
    (because you must meld to the existing melds to go out)




----------------------
v0.3.00 Graphics
- make cards bigger - why aren't they expanding to fill available space
Melding/Discard:
    - Drag to create melds, or [Meld] button for computer version
        - how do you show outline of meld?
    - grey out not-real cards in partial melds
    - highlight discard when we're about to select it, or show Toast as we move across
    - DONE: make discard draggable; snap discard only when it reaches the pile
    - short Touch for drag?
    - Better [Play] and [Meld] button design (find a good image)
- Use Toasts (with string resources) for instructions instead of infoLine/mGameInfo
- DONE: Fix annoying menu popup problem
- Find a suit of Stars
- visual cue for buttons and piles (flash or change color)
- Landscape layout
- update scores throughout final turn
- put deal icon next to the dealer
- DONE: Replace LinearLayouts with RelativeLayouts
- DONE: Click on scores should allow editing names
- DONE: Long press on [Play] should be something (new game)
- Show only computer melds when they go out, and what they discard
    - make it a setting so we can put it in the menu later (fow now in a settings dialog?)
- Convert showScores to use ListView and get rid of nasty invisible fields - use set/getTag??
    - use mock fields (perhaps Computer, You) to get layout width better
    - [+] button to add Players (disable after game starts)
    -
