DONE v0.4.01 : Melding/Scoring/Valuation

Hand:
- NOT DONE: Present sorted?

Scoring/Valuation:- move to separate class
- DONE: Card should only know about base scoring and perhaps return two different values (base score and wildcard score) - move scoring out of it
- DONE: A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds;
- DONE: On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize
- DONE: Stuff from piece of paper / notes on iPad
- DONE: Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - DONE: Different scoring for when I have 1 or 2 cards unmelded (should be looking to meld to existing)

- DONE: use isTestBetterThanBest in considering permutations
    - >>> override 1/2 value for partial melds ??(necessary? now that we are promoting other measures)

Previously Done:
    - DONE: Move out of getHighestScoreCard
    - DONE: Permuations Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0
    - DONE: Loop over discards - this will allow us to merge some code
    - DONE: reuse Meld.check within meldAndEvaluate
-     DONE: have a permutations version without an added card


-----------------------
v0.4.02 Bug fixes and clean-up
- TODO:A's (especially in scoring)
- Lint warnings
- More final parameters

TESTING

Both (but especially permutations)
DONE: Meld: Mark what type of meld it is: full/partial, sequence/rank
- Make Meld a standalone class?
DONE: a partial rank meld >> partial sequence > partial sequence at one end = broken sequence
DONE: A rank meld > rank meld with wildcards > sequence meld


----------------------
v0.4.03
- change takeComputerTurn and takeHumanTurn to Player methods
- comments from Catherine
    - Cancel dealing animation if you press button
- BUG:A When you continue with a new game, or delete a player sometimes the old Layouts are not all removed
- Look at CardList implementation and consider LinkedHashSet or others which provide
    - check for non-duplicates
    - automatic ordering
- Look at Player list in Game for better encapsulation
    - track what is left in DrawPile (or cheat and remember it)
    - Cheat mode where it peeks at draw pile card
- BUG:A: This doesn't handle if removed player is the dealer

- Guard against human trying to put all cards in one meld (and it working!)
    - if it's *not* a meld, can we bail early? (depends which mode we're testing in)
----------------------
v0.5.00: Menu
- [Meld] button? With count? (goes away after you use it up)
- Instructions
- Settings
    - Computer cheats by looking at Draw Pile
    - Show other players cards with/except for next player after you
- Play
    - Start a new game with new players

- Add an extra click to expose your cards if human players are next to each other
    - just use normal [Play Turn] button currently used for Computer hands
    - remove [Next Button] , except for Humans
    - replace [Play Computer] with touching the cards or some other gesture

- Hibernate state if forced to
- Clean up Game state flow and handling
- Look at use of Static and Inner classes
- About with Version number and contact information


-------------------
v0.6.00 Graphics
- FiveKings bugs/todo's
- Celebrate on final result! Show score table at end - possibly with round-by-round scores?
    - DONE: make a particularly big round score Red when it's scored
    - other comments like Phase 10: pick up a discard and say "Thanks! I really needed that" or "Ouch!"
- Animate open hands into view from mini-hands
- Animate dealing discard (use z-axis flip of card over?)
- Fix translation using exact positions on screen
    - Instead of using Intrinsic width, should use actual laid out width etc
- Hint overlays like Google (arrows and text)
- investigate using Callback instead of Listener (does it make it easier to find card?)
- make cards bigger - why aren't they expanding to fill available space
- Find a suit of Stars
- Add button to [Meld] for you (with a number of times you can use it?)
    - or only in first few rounds
- Better [Play] and [Meld] button design (find a good image)
    - replace button at bottom of screen with spinner or arrow to click
- LOTS of cleaning up in FiveKings - follow flow
- Slide out hand animation
- Touch Computer hand to play it
- Landscape layout: isn't switching automatically when I turn the device

Previously Done:
    - DONE: On New Game, should clear Scores when you get to Round 3
    - DONE: Background watermark: Drag your melds into here (or equivalent)
    - DONE: Fix annoying menu popup problem
    - DONE: Replace LinearLayouts with RelativeLayouts
    - DONE: Click on scores should allow editing names
    - DONE: Long press on [Play] should be something (new game)
    - DONE: Players show as backs of cards in semi-circle above play area
    - DONE: Animation when a card is picked from Draw or Discard



-----------------
v0.6.01 Graphics
- Modify single layout dynamically if you switch to landscape mode

----------------
v0.7.01 Scoring and Valuation
- Look at melding "potential" of single unmelded cards you keep (not just partial melds)
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
Permutations:
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?
- ??use sorted lists
- implement Meld.needsCheck
BUG:A Check if still true? Heuristics is throwing away wildcard when you have a partial meld of 4-4 and only full melds;
BUG:A Permutations won't build a K onto T*Q

Heuristics:
BUG:A Heuristics won't build a sequence X-Y-Jok-Z; not looking at this - use meld.check?
Add in more than one sequence and longer sequences than 3
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)
Use Meld.check somehow?
    - note the numCard breakpoint when we switched to permutations and don't look for sequences bigger than this
    - should allow us to build bigger sequences

-----------------
v1.1.01 Optimization
- Use multi-threading to preprocess computer hands while waiting for button presses

======================
QUESTIONS:
1. When to use a Base Class vs. an Interface? Abstract Class vs. Interface vs Base Class? Is Virtual Class something different?
