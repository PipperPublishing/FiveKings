v0.1.10 Clean-up
- DONE: clean up getters and setters (call from own class); eliminate setters where possible
- DONE: clean up Game
- DONE: Draw is empty, then redeal from Discard - make inner or static classes?

---------
DONE v0.1.11 Clean-up
- DONE: Clean up Hand
- DONE: Clean up Player;
- DONE: Edit comments
- DONE: Fix TODO:A which are not graphics
- DONE: Make Hand an inner class of Player

---------
DONE v0.2.01 Graphics - Manual melding
- DONE remove UI hiding code (left systemUIHider); possible make banner smaller or go away
- DONE: Use Toasts (with string resources) for instructions instead of mGameInfo
Melding/Discard:
  DONE: Don't display partial melds - store them internally for scoring only
  DONE: Drag to do your own melding
  DONE: highlight discard when we're about to select it, or show Toast as we move across
  DONE: make discard draggable; snap discard only when it reaches the pile
- DONE: Show only computer melds when they go out, and what they discard

---------------------------
v0.2.02 Graphics: Clearer melding
- DONE: Comments changes/adds in Player/Hand
- DONE: can you do drag without LongClick (and somehow combine with multi-select)
    - DONE: short Touch for select for melding (then drag to melding area)?
- DONE: move cards from left-hand-edge
- DONE: new layout is extending whole width - reset somehow to edge of meld?
DONE On "pick a card"  - animation of cards lifting off


-----------------------------
>>> v0.2.03 Graphics - animations for pick-up + Clean-up
DONE:TODO:A's
DONE: Remove deprecated classes and code
DONE: reuse alpha animation
DONE: Clean up Hand and Meld in Player - excessive getters?
DONE: Empty dashed line "Drag here to make a new meld"
DONE: Animation for picking and discarding (for computer)

------------------------------
0.2.04 Graphics - [Meld] button, Clean user experience
- Add button to [Meld] for you
- On LongPress for New Game, pop up a confirmation dialog
- Animation that meets in the middle between piles and hand
    - Copy CardView so that replacement cards are there after animation begins


---------------------------
v0.3.00 : Melding/Scoring/Valuation
- Stuff from piece of paper / notes on iPad
    - Loop over discards - this will allow us to merge some code
    - reuse Meld.check within meldAndEvaluate
- if Computer is out, should just use Discard pile
Hand:
- Present sorted?
- TODO:A's
- DONE: have a permutations version without an added card

Scoring/Valuation:- move to separate class
- DONE: Move out of getHighestScoreCard
- Card should only know about base scoring and perhaps return two different values (base score and wildcard score) - move scoring out of it
- A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds; a partial rank meld > partial sequence
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
- KD sequence is lower frequency, so not preferred over rank melds
- On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize

- Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - Different scoring for when I have 1 or 2 cards unmelded (should be looking to meld to existing)
    - track what is left in DrawPile (or cheat and remember it)
    - Cheat mode where it peeks at draw pile card
    - In the round of n, if you already have m cards in melds, then if m+3 >n then you should value a partial meld at full value
    (because you must meld to the existing melds to go out)
- Guard against human trying to put all cards in one meld (and it working!)
    - if it's *not* a meld, can we bail early? (depends which mode we're testing in)


Permutations:
- DONE: Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?
- use sorted lists
- implement Meld.needsCheck

Heuristics:
- Add in more than one sequence
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)
- Use Meld.check somehow? (but note the numCard breakpoint when we switched to permutations)

----------------------
v0.3.01
- Look at CardList implementation and consider LinkedHashSet or others which provide
    - check for non-duplicates
    - automatic ordering

-------------------
v0.4.00 Graphics
- Players Scores
    - Bug editing
    TODO:A Look at switching to ListView, especially since all Table Rows are the same
- Hint overlays like Google (arrows and text)
- investigate using Callback instead of Listener (does it make it easier to find card?)
- make cards bigger - why aren't they expanding to fill available space
- Background watermark: Drag your melds into here (or equivalent)
- DONE: Fix annoying menu popup problem
- Find a suit of Stars
- Better [Play] and [Meld] button design (find a good image)
- Landscape layout
- update scores throughout final turn
- put deal icon next to the dealer
- some visual indication of who went out (radio buttons)
- DONE: Replace LinearLayouts with RelativeLayouts
- DONE: Click on scores should allow editing names
- DONE: Long press on [Play] should be something (new game)
- Convert showScores to use ListView and get rid of nasty invisible fields - use set/getTag??
    - use mock fields (perhaps Computer, You) to get layout width better
    - [+] button to add Players (disable after game starts)
    - DIsplay Radio Button next to current player? Or highlight?
- Players show as backs of cards in semi-circle above play area
- Animation when a card is picked from Draw or Discard
- LOTS of cleaning up in FiveKings - follow flow
