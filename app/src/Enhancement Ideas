----------------------
v0.2.00 Graphics
- highlight discard when we're about to select it, or show Toast as we move across
- make discard draggable; snap discard only when it reaches the pile
- allow dragging for melds
- Add [Meld] button to meld for you and make default behavior to not meld
- Fix annoying menu popup problem
    - what is standard behavior? I think current behavior is because it's a "fullscreen" app
    - Show bottom strip all the time, and top when you swipe down
- Find a suit of Stars
- Better [Play] and [Meld] button design (find a good image)
- visual cue for buttons and piles
- Landscape layout
- update scores throughout final turn
- put Dealer next to the dealer
- DONE: Replace LinearLayouts with RelativeLayouts
- DONE: Click on scores should allow editing names
- DONE: Long press on [Play] should be something (new game)
- Show only computer melds when they go out, and what they discard



---------------------------
v0.3.00 : Scoring/Valuation
Scoring/Valuation:
- A hand with n melds should score higher than any hand with n-1 melds; a partial rank meld > partial sequence
- Don't discard what others want (wild cards, or cards they picked up)
- KD sequence is lower frequency, so not preferred over rank melds
- On round of 5's , play to win rather than to minimize
- Currently draws Discard Pile card if it lowers valuation; but should consider Draw Pile if probability of an even lower card
    - track what is left in DrawPile (or cheat and remember it)
    - Cheat mode where it peeks at draw pile card

Permutations:
- Can stop when we find one with Valuation=0
- Look at descending sequences so we can throw them out sooner
- Eliminate looking at other perms that are equivalent score (e.g. (K* KS KH) = (KS K* KH)) - use a hash?


Heuristics:
- Add in more than one sequence
- Loop over fullMeld and fullSequence alternatives (use perms?)
- Discard: find largest meld; remove card
- create separate list without wildcards - would remove the checks we have to do
